# This project contains URL Shortener implementation example

This is a playground where I'm implementing various URL shorteners to
see how each one works on different coditions, which is better in terms of
performance, CPU, MEM, Time limitations.

> Project is developed in `Python3.10` & using `TDD` approach.
