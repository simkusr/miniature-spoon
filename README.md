# This project contains URL Shortener implementation example

This is a playground where I will be implementing various URL shorteners to
see how each one works on different conditions to determine which is better in terms of
performance, CPU, MEM, Time limitations using Python language.

> Project is developed in `Python3.10` & using `TDD` approach.


## TODO

1. Implement URL shortener
Currently I did a dummy `hash` for url shortener
